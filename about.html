        <h1 class="about-h1">The Japanese Car Culture</h1>

                <p>During the years following their post-World War
                II Allied occupation, Japan's automotive industry
                expanded explosively and saw them eventually
                grow into the world's largest vehicle production
                powerhouse, synonymous with quality and reliability.</p> 

                <img src="images/about1.jpg">

                <p>As personal vehicles became cheaper and more accessible,
                they found their way more into the everyday lives of the
                Japanese population. Naturally from this came the rise
                of multiple subcultures revolving around their newfound 
                mobility.</p>

                <img src="images/about2.jpg">

                <p>One of the most notorious of these are the Bosozoku, 
                gangs of youths terrorising the streets with their cars
                and bikes as their way of rebelling against society.
                Their exploits of reckless driving, gang violence and
                generally disturbing the peace have been extensively
                documented throughout the years, and while we don't
                condone criminal activity, their style is undeniable
                and their culture continues to inform and influence
                fans to this day. </p>

                <img src="images/about3.jpeg">


                <p>Another group from this era you might've come across
                before are Kaido racers. Inspired by 70s and 80s race
                cars, they're hard to miss with their ground-scraping 
                ride height, tall extended exhaust pipes, huge 
                overfenders with wide wheels to match and wild custom 
                bodywork. </p>

                <img src="images/about4.jpeg">


                <p>While there might be some crossover between these
                groups, they're not interchangeable and shouldn't be
                confused.</p>

                <img src="images/about5.jpg">

                <p>One of the many people who consider these times to
                be the golden age of Japan's automotive scene is Mitch
                Meade, an enthusiast of late Showa era (1926-1989) cars
                who has been documenting the scene since 2017 as the 
                appropriately named Showa Racing. </p>
